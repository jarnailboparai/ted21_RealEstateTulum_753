  <b>1. Can a foreign individual, corporation, or trust own property in Mexico, or is it a lease?</b><br>
<br>
Yes you can own property in Mexico, and no it is not a lease. Decades 
ago, the law did not allow foreigners of any sort to own property within
 30 miles of the coastal waters, and within 50 miles of the borders. The
 purpose of this legislation was to protect Mexico’s sovereignty though 
the establishment of the restricted zone. Today, the most common way to 
own residential property along the Mexican coastline or borders is 
trough a “Mexican Trust” called Fideicomiso. The “Trust” is completely 
safe and provides foreign individual, corporations, and trusts with all 
the rights of ownership. A Mexican bank is required by law to administer
 and represent an owner of a Mexican Trust. The beneficiary of a “Trust”
 can be a foreign individual, corporation, or trust.<br>
<br><b>
2. Can I establish a Mexican corporation?</b><br>
<br>
Yes. To create a Mexican corporation is a fairly simple matter that 
requires a minimum of two partners, both of which can be foreigners. A 
Mexican corporation is permitted to purchase real property and/or 
operate a business. Virtually all Mexican corporations hire an 
accountant (CPR) to handle the required paperwork; given that accounting
 and tax declaration is complicated due to the existing fiscal laws 
which change frequently, and with the addition of new laws which occur 
often.<br>
<br><b>
3. What would the annual expenses be for Mexican property?</b><br>
<br>
Property tax (“predial”): Based on the Municipality appraisal value. A 
4-bedroom house on the ocean pays between $1,000 and $1,500 USD Bank 
Trust fee: Each bank has different fees. Some have a fixed rate and some
 others calculate it according to the appraised value of the property. 
You can expect yearly fee between $500.00 and $1,000.00 USD Federal Zone
 tax: If your property is right on the beach you will pay this tax every
 year, and it is calculated on the frontage of the lot. A 66-foot ocean 
front lot pays about $400.00 USD a year.<br>
<br><b>
4. Can I rent my property while I’m not using it?</b><br>
<br>
Yes. Many people are aware of this area given the tourist tradition of 
the last 25 years. Recently, the internet exposure has increased the 
awareness of this area considerably. There are a number of rental 
organizations that contribute to a high occupancy rate. Some owners 
handle their rentals successfully through a web site. Property rental is
 an excellent way to quickly recover your initial investment.<br>
<br><b>
5. How can I provide maintenance to the property and cover the expenses if I don’t live in Mexico?</b><br>
<br>
Most condominium buildings have an on site administrator who takes care 
of the property. A monthly maintenance fee is paid by each unit to cover
 expenses. Most houses have a casita (small house) at the entrance to a 
property that houses the caretaker. The caretaker provides various 
services to the owner and guests. The cost for caretaker service is 
easily offset through rentals.<br>
Property Managers are also available. They provide services such as 
property maintenaince, paying utility bills, purchasing cleaning 
supplies, paying salaries, supervision of employees, greeting and 
assisting your guests, and coordinating the immediate repairs the 
property may need. todotulum Real Estate is happy to recommend Property 
Managers in the area.<br>
<br><b>
6. Can I bring my own furniture and appliances from a foreign country to Mexico?</b><br>
<br>
Yes. You can bring in one shipment of personal belongings which includes
 appliances for the property. In order to eliminate problems, accurate 
paperwork is required. Usually, arrangements are made in Mexico prior to
 bringing or shipping your belongings. In the past years this was a 
common practice. Today, you can find a good variety of just about 
everything you need in Cancun and Playa del Carmen. Most often the 
prices of merchandise is slightly higher than the US or Canada. You must
 factor in the cost of shipping or transporting your belongings which 
can be expensive. The stores in Cancun include Sam’s Club, Wal-Mart, 
Costco, Home Depot, Sears, Office Max, Office Depot, as well as many 
Mexican stores and department stores. Playa del Carmen now has Sam’s 
Club, Wal-Mart, and other large grocery, furniture, hardware, and decor 
stores.<br>
<br><b>
7. Can I import my vehicle from a foreign country?</b><br>
<br>
Yes. According to the law, the maximum time you can import your vehicle 
is for a 6 months period. Recent legislation states that you do not have
 to leave the country and renew your vehicles papers as long as you have
 a valid tourist or FM3 visa. In any case, a trip to the southern border
 at Chetumal is only 2.5 hours from Tulum. In Chetumal you can renew 
your importation certificate. On the way there are some interesting 
places to visit You can either drive your car into Mexico, or have your 
vehicle shipped from Miami to Puerto Morelos.<br>
<br><b>
8. How complicated is it to retire in Mexico?</b><br>
<br>
This part of Mexico is becoming ideal for retired people. There is an 
important American community increasing continuously, attracted by the 
beauties of the area, the warm winters, and practically no crime. Cancun
 provides daily direct flights to the major cities of the United States 
and Europe. To obtain your immigration status as retired is a matter of a
 few days and about $500.00 USD, if you hire a lawyer for the paper 
work. It is less expensive if you do it yourself, however we recommend 
using a lawyer or legal firm with experience to facilitate the process.<br>
<br><b>
9. How complicated is it to move to and work in Mexico?</b><br>
<br>
It is much easier than for a Mexican to get established in the States. 
You can either open a corporation or work for someone else. If you are 
going to work for someone else you will need a letter stating they are 
offering you the job, explaining your position in the organization and 
the salary you will receive. If you are opening a corporation you can 
get your immigration papers as the administrator of your company and you
 will need a notary and a reliable accountant firm. In any case, 
todotulu.com can assist you in the process and advise you. We have a 
large list of clients whom we have helped with this issue.<br>
<br><b>
10. What kind of financing is available in a real estate purchase?</b><br>
<br>
Presently there are a few American institutions providing financing to 
Americans and Canadians in order to purchase houses or condominiums that
 are already built. In most transactions, the only financing is provided
 by the seller. Most transactions are by cash or transfers with the 
purchaser making arrangements back home.
